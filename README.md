# JWD-console

## Goal
### Learn how to build a simple java app using just CLI

## Process
You may find the process from creating packages to running the application with console [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qYXjPFZ2Hr-kBCR_P9XMTzl4TygnufubEQOkdroZDfI/edit?usp=sharing).

* In order to compile and run the app you need to download **Apache Log4j 2**  from the [original site](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html).
